# fractal_tree.py
this file contains a straightforward implamentation of the Fractal tree (as shown in wikapedia)

# tree.py
this file contains a different version of the Fractal tree, with randomised lengths and and added rules.
One of the things added is another character "X" this is displayed in red when the tree is drawn and on the next recursion will generate a branch with a random angle from 30 degrees to 30 degrees
